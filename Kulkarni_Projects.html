                        <p> In <strong>CSE</strong>(Computer Science And Software Engineering) class, we had a task to complete, which was to make make an app that is in the range of your team's difficulty level.
                My team member(Nicholas Jumaga) and I had decided that we should further modify the original app which was 
                called No Text While Driving for AI2. My team altered the name to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hse7lF-m3FyrDqSIq-5WkUL2Fzz2rHsIR5WU8npcXfc/edit"> 
                Text By Voice</a> later on.  This app responded to incoming texts by sending an automatic text response.The objective of this MIT App Inventor Project
                was to create an app that authorizes a person to send a verbal message while they are on the road. The adapted version of our app is called
                Text By Voice. We decided that people can be more focused on the road,and they can possibly be more accident-free. This project intrigued me and my partner 
                because most accidents these days are caused due to texting while driving. The app I made was extremely memorable for me because I had worked nights to 
                complete every part of the project on time since I was the sole programmer. Text By Voice was quite a challenge for me because I wasn't able 
                to figure out the actual code for about five days, but things eventually came to into place. This project was completed over the span of 4 weeks
                <strong>(9/20/17-10/17/17)</strong>. The MIT App Inventor project was an strenuous but pleasurable experience for me, because it was my first time using a program like
                MIT App Inventor.
