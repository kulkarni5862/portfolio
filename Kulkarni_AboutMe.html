                        <p>Hi! My name is Sanika Kulkarni, and I am a freshman currently attending Dublin High School, and my career goal in life is to be a successful 
                        entrepreneur. I am involved with clubs that help me with my presentation and marketing skills, such as DECA. DECA stands for Distributive 
                        Education Clubs of America. I plan to go in the business field because I feel that I have the skills to engage in conversations and make people feel comfortable. 
                        </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                <div text align="justify">
                    <p>The reason for choosing business as my career choice is that I carry specific qualities that will allow me to emerge into an aspiring leader. I am energetic and 
                    friendly throughout the year which exhibits my passion towards this profession. Currently, I have no major achievements
                    yet, but I have participated in DECA conferences and competitions, where business professionals give training to young individuals and offer tips on how to market yourself.

                <div text align="justify">
                  <p>As per my experiences, such as being on a sports team or joining a club, I have learned that time management is a helping hand. Every single minute is essential and vital to an individual.
                  Having homework, playing a sport, and being in a club is very overwhelming and time consuming. Managing time
                  can help you stay focused and organized, which can reduce a person's level of stress.</p>

                <div text align="justify">
                    <p>To end on good note, I'd like to say that becoming a business professional would mean that my hardwork has finally paid off.
                    Experiences that are yet to come in my lifetime will help me learn all the necessities in order to become
                    affluent later on in my life. If you have visited my page today, thank you so much for reaching out to my project!
                    Other than that, if you would like to know anything about me, my family, my resume, my projects,
                    or how to contact me, please feel free to browse my webpage.</p>
